WriteSphere - A MERN Stack Blogging Platform
A full-featured blogging platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This application is designed to be a modern, scalable solution for content creators, offering robust features for user authentication, content management, and administrative control.

Key Features
User Authentication & Authorization: Secure, JWT-based authentication ensures that users can register, log in, and manage their own content.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The system supports user and admin roles, providing specific permissions and functionalities for each.

Blog Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their own blog posts. The platform includes a rich text editor for a seamless writing experience.

File Uploads: Easily upload blog thumbnails and other assets using Multer.

Search & Filtering: Users can quickly find blogs by searching for titles or filtering by categories.

User Profiles: Public-facing profiles display a user's published blogs, while a private dashboard provides a focused view of their personal content.

Admin Dashboard: Administrators have elevated privileges, including the ability to delete any blog post on the platform.
